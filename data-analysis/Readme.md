# Data Science 6 Step Process

1. Frame the problem
2. **Collect the raw data you need for you problem**
3. **Process the data for analysis**
4. **Explore the data**
5. **Perform in-depth analysis**
6. Communicate your results

#### In Data Analysis we mostly focus on Step 2 to 5.

### Frame the problem

Before you can solve a problem, you need to define the problem.

### Collecting Data

Once you've defined the problem, you'll need data to give you the insight needed to develop a solution

### Processing the Data for Analysis

After you've collected all the raw data, you'll need to process it before you can do any analysis.

You will see errors that corrupt your analysis: null instead of zero, missing values, duplicates

Common errors:
1. Missing values
2. Corrupted values
3. Timezone differences
4. Data range errors, such as data registered from before sales started.

### Explore the Data

When your data is clean, you should start playing with it.

The difficulty here is coming up with ideas that are likely to tu

At this point, you can now begin to trace these patterns to analyze the data more deeply.

### Perform in-depth analysis

This step of the process is where you will need to apply your statistical, mathematical and technological knowledge, and leverage all the data science tools at your disposal to crunch the data and find every insight you can.

### Communicate your results

You can now combine all of those qualitative insights with data from your quantitative analysis to craft a story that moves people to action.

Your ability to properly communicate your results will define the difference between action and inaction on your proposals.
You need to craft a compelling story that ties in your data with their knowledge.
